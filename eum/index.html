        <a href="https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild">EasyBuild</a> is a software build and installation framework
        that allows you to manage (scientific) software on High Performance Computing (HPC) systems in an efficient
        way.</p>
        <p>
        The <strong>EasyBuild User Meeting</strong> is an open and highly interactive event that provides a great opportunity
        to meet fellow EasyBuild enthusiasts, discuss related topics and learn about new aspects of the tool.

        It is intended for people that are already familiar with EasyBuild, ranging from occasional users to
        EasyBuild core developers and experts, and topics will be less introductory in nature than during
        EasyBuild hackathons/workshops that have been organized in the past.

        The program includes presentations by both EasyBuild users and developers,
        as well as talks about open source projects relevant to the EasyBuild community.

        In this talk series we will present <em>ReFrame</em>, a framework for writing regression tests for
        HPC systems. The goal of the ReFrame is to abstract away the complexity of the interactions with
        the system, separating the logic of a regression test from the low-level details, which pertain to
        the system configuration and setup. This allows users to write easily portable regression tests,
        focusing only on the functionality. We will start with an introductory talk about the framework and
        its capabilities, which we will gradually explore in more depth in the subsequent series of
        tutorial talks.

        Delivering complex software across a worldwide distributed
        infrastructure of data centers and supercomputers is a major challenge
        in scientific computing. Copying the entire software stack everywhere
        it’s needed is often impractical and inefficient -- software stacks can
        grow very large, new versions are produced frequently, while any given
        job only needs a small fraction of the total software.

        To address application delivery at scale, CernVM-FS distributes software to
        hundreds of thousands of machines around the world in the form of a
        global, purpose-built shared software area. This presentation gives a
        technology overview and discusses use cases, experience from operations,
        and future plans.

        Easy-Build Singularity Containers (presentation)
        </strong></p>
        <p><em>

        </em></p>
        <p>
        Reproducibility in research and science is an important aspect. Without this, any result obtained is
        more or less useless. Whereas in the real world we are conducting an experiment a few times, like
        3 analysis of a compound, large field studies for vaccinations etc, in the virtual world we are not
        always able to afford this. This is particularly true for larger HPC calculations where the resources
        are simply often not there. Thus, we need to make sure that we are not generating random numbers,
        but we are generating meaningful results which are relevant to the real world.</p>
        <p>For this reason we need to benchmark our computational studies and we need to be able to reproduce
        the installation. One way forward here is of course EasyBuild, which is installing the software in a
        reproducible way.</p>
        <p>However, not all HPC facilities have such a sotware management tool installed. On top of that,
        in particular in the Bioinformatic Community, users are often running long pipelines or have very
        special requirements on the way the software is installed. This can make it a bit more difficult to
        reproduce results between different HPC facilities. One way forward here is for example a container
        solution like Singularity.</p>
        <p>In this presentation we are showing a way how to combine the best of the two worlds: using EasyBuild
        for the software installation and using Singularity for the platform-independant way to run the
        calculations. We show how a set of simple bash-scripts enables users like for example clinitians,
        who are not that Linux savvy, to create such containers easily.

        People who frequently use different systems know: each and every vendor
        or distribution typically maintains it own setup of software packages.
        While tools like sed and awk may give small annoyances on which flags to
        use based on whether the tools are GNU or BSD-based, something like a
        compiler may be a completely different version, causing considerable
        problems for development purposes.</p>
        <p>Gentoo Prefix aims to build the exact same software, with the exact same
        patches and configuration on a multitude of distributions.  The major
        targets are macOS, Linux, and Solaris-based, aiming at ppc, x86 and
        sparc based architectures.</p>
        <p>In this talk we will walk through a bit of the history of the project,
        how it works, using Gentoo tooling, and its current state.

            European Environment for Scientific Software Installations (EESSI)

        <p><em>

        </em></p>
        <p>
        The <em>European Environment for Scientific Software Installations</em> (<em>EESSI</em>,
        pronounced as "easy") is a collaboration between different HPC sites and industry partners,
        with the common goal to set up a shared repository of scientific software installations that
        can be used on a variety of systems, regardless of which flavor/version of Linux distribution
        or processor architecture is used, or whether it is a full-size HPC cluster, a cloud environment
        or a personal workstation.</p>

        <p>The concept of the EESSI project was inspired by the Compute Canada software stack,<br/>
        and consists of three main layers:
        <ul>
            <li>a <em>filesystem layer</em> leveraging the established CernVM-FS technology, to globally distribute
                the EESSI software stack;</li>
            <li>a <em>compatibility layer</em> using Gentoo Prefix, to ensure compatibility with different client
                operating systems (different Linux distributions, macOS, Windows Subsystem for Linux);</li>
            <li>a <em>software layer</em>, hosting optimized installations of scientific software along with required
                dependencies, which were built for different processor architectures, and where archspec,
                EasyBuild and Lmod are leveraged;</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p>In this talk, we will present how the EESSI project grew out of a need for more collaboration to
        tackle the challenges in the changing landscape of scientific software and HPC system architectures.
        The project structure will be explained in more detail, covering the motivation for the layered approach
        and the choice of tools, as well as the lessons learned from the work done by Compute Canada.
        The goals we have in mind and how we plan to achieve them going forward will be outlined.</p>

        <p>Finally, we will demonstrate the current pilot version of the project, and give you a feeling of
        the potential impact.

        BLIS is a portable software framework for instantiating high-performance BLAS-like dense linear

        of BLIS, including its history, its design considerations, the APIs it exports, its implementations
        and how they promote productivity and maintainability, performance on modern hardware, its community
        organization, its impact on the HPC ecosystem, and our plans for the future.

        Easy-Build Singularity Containers: tutorial

        <p>
        In this hands on tutorial we will build 2 containers: a simple one to give users an understanding of
        how the set of scripts are working and how we can build for example Debian or CentOS containers without
        much knowledge of the background mechanisms. In the second, more advanced part, we show how to open up
        the containers and give users are chance to install their bespoken pipelines and use the power of the
        containers to run that on virtually any suitable platform.

        buildtest: Testing Framework for HPC systems
        </strong></p>

        <a href="https://buildtest.readthedocs.io/en/devel/index.html">Buildtest</a> is an HPC testing
        framework to aid HPC facilities to perform acceptance testing for their system. HPC systems are
        growing in complexity, with a tightly coupled software and system stack that requires a degree of
        automation and continuous testing. In the past decade, two build frameworks (Spack, EasyBuild)
        have emerged and widely used in HPC community for automating build & installation process for
        scientific software. On the contrary, testing frameworks for HPC systems are limited to a few
        handful (ReFrame, Pavilion2, buildtest) that are in active development. In buildtest, users will
        write test recipes in YAML called buildspecs  that is the primary interface for writing tests.
        buildtest utilizes a JSON Schema for validating buildspecs. In this talk we will present an overview
        of buildtest and how one can write buildspecs. Furthermore, we will discuss Cori Testsuite in
        buildtest with several real examples on testing various components for Cori system at NERSC. Finally,
        we will present an overview of the E4S Test Suite, which is an ECP project to help test the Spack E4S
        software stack, and how buildtest integrates with E4S Testsuite.

        Automate Module Testing with Lmodule
        </strong></p>
        <p><em>
        by Shahzeb Siddiqui (NERSC, US)
        </em></p>
        <p>
        HPC software stacks have become increasingly complex and significantly grown in size with some sites
        having up to 5,000+ modulefiles. It's imperative that all modules are tested because it is the primary
        interface for users to interact with the software stack.
        <a href="https://lmodule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">LModule</a> is a Python API for Lmod, with a focus
        on automating module testing. Lmodule is able to query a software stack via the '<em>spider</em>' Lmod
        tool, and individually test each module using "<em>module load</em>". The API consist of three Python
        classes: <em>Module</em>, <em>Spider</em>, and <em>ModuleLoadTest</em>.
        Lmodule works with Environment Modules.
        In this talk we will present an overview of the Lmodule API at Cori (environment-modules) and
        OLCF (Lmod), to demonstrate how we can automate module testing of software stacks.
